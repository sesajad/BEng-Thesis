	abstract = {This paper builds the theory of Fourier analysis on ﬁnite groups. First, Fourier analysis on the real domain is discussed. Then, Fourier analysis on ﬁnite abelian groups is developed. After this, a brief introduction to representation theory allows for the discussion of Fourier analysis on all ﬁnite groups. Algorithms are designed to perform these transforms, building to the eﬃcient algorithm developed by Diaconis and Rockmore. Finally, an implementation of this algorithm for computing Fourier transforms on Sn is demonstrated.},

It is known to be universal for pure state qubit quantum mechanics, meaning any pure state, unitary operation and post-selected pure projective measurement can be expressed in the {ZX}-calculus. The calculus is also sound, i.e. any equality that can be derived graphically can also be derived using matrix mechanics. Here, we show that the {ZX}-calculus is complete for pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics, meaning any equality that can be derived using matrices can also be derived pictorially. The proof relies on bringing diagrams into a normal form based on graph states and local Clifford operations.},

	abstract = {We study quantum algorithms for problems in computational geometry, such as Point-On3-Lines problem. In this problem, we are given a set of lines and we are asked to ﬁnd a point that lies on at least 3 of these lines. Point-On-3-Lines and many other computational geometry problems are known to be 3Sum-Hard. That is, solving them classically requires time Ω(n2−o(1)), unless there is faster algorithm for the well known 3Sum problem (in which we are given a set S of n integers and have to determine if there are a, b, c ∈ S such that a + b + c = 0). Quantumly, 3Sum can be solved in time O(n log n) using Grover’s quantum search algorithm. This leads to a question: can we solve Point-On-3-Lines and other 3Sum-Hard problems in O(nc) time quantumly, for c {\textless} 2? We answer this question aﬃrmatively, by constructing a quantum algorithm that solves {PointOn}-3-Lines in time O(n1+o(1)). The algorithm combines recursive use of amplitude ampliﬁcation with geometrical ideas. We show that the same ideas give O(n1+o(1)) time algorithm for many 3Sum-Hard geometrical problems.},
